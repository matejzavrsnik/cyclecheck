This application compares three different link list cycle searching algorithms. Linked lists are automatically created for this purpouse, you just need to enter parameters that are relevant for these algorithms to start processing. The parameters needed are size of the linked list and the element where the linked list goes into a loop. The job of every algorithm is then whether this linked list has a loop, and if it has, which element is the start of it. To automatically create linked list click create, to find cycles click on algorithm name. To repeat the experiment just click create again. 

To test if the algorithm is correct, you enter -1 as the element at which the loop starts, which should mean there is no loop at all. Mind that the loop start number is zero based, so are the results. Be careful though, entering too many elements for a linked list will quickly fill up your memory. In case of naive algorithm it will also take a looong time for an application to finish. Start with small first and mind the fact, that it's complexity is O(nÂ²) ;) 

I didn't install many input validations. I believe that the audience interested in this piece of software will be smart. ;) 

Finding a loop in a linked list very quickly is probably not something you will need to think about in your commercial projects, but if you need the code you are free to use mine. I am distributing it under MIT licence (text below). If you found it usefull, drop me a line if you can, I'd like to know.
